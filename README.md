# Camjaira Webserver
Pretty ok django project for school

## Setup
Before you can use the camjaira webserver, you need the following things.

1. Python 3.11 or newer
2. A venv with django and pillow libraries

## SETTING THE VENV
When you open the project directory, keep an eye for the 'venv' folder
Delete it if it is in the project, you have to make your own.

Open the terminal or powershell in the project and make a venv:

``python -m venv venv``

! INSTALLING LIBRARIES ONTO THE VENV
Next you need to install the new libraries, before that, activate the venv first:

    ```venv/scripts/activate```

You do need to do this everytime for every powershell or terminal instance.
Moving on, you can simply install the libraries:

    ```pip install django, pillow```
